    Added some more features starting with a basic Pagination to keep the dataset organized I have the defualt val set at 12 and in the url I keep it at 12 to have 12 total pages as there are 144 members. It will show 12 gymnasts per page. I also added the rest of the data in the data set for a total of 8 columns and I changed the styling of the page. as well as some naming schemes. Next Steps are creating a more organized layout ie adding a landing page, dedicated dataset page, and dedicated visuals page then refine styling. After this I will go into the specifics for features like sorting / filtering, advanced pagination and more !

    added a better directory system for the frontend folder to specify components, services, and styles. I added the first fetch of data from the world champ csv just getting the name, overallrank, and nationality of each gymnast. I also edited the background color of the app getting a linear gradient blue and midnight purple want to get white stars in background soon and add the rest of the data along with visuals and filtering / sorting methods.
